# AI Umrah Assistant (Master Thesis Project)

This repository contains the source code and resources for the **AI Umrah Assistant Project** as part of my **Master Thesis at Leeds Beckett University**. 
The project aims to create an artificial intelligent system that assists Umrah pilgrims by answering queries related to Umrah practices, rituals, and travel logistics by exploring the combination of **fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Turbo**, **Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **Real-Time Web Scraping**.

## Project Overview:
The increasing number of Umrah and Hajj pilgrims presents both opportunities and challenges in managing large-scale religious tourism efficiently (General Authority for Statistics, 2023). Despite this huge numbers, the KSA government aims to grow the amount of external Umrah visitors to 30 million by the year 2030 (Vision2030, 2023). On the other hand, while the adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasing across various domains, in the realm Umrah and Hajj, the application of LLMs remains largely unexplored. 
- **Aim and Objectives**: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of combining fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with real-time web scraping on the performance of a pre-trained model (GPT-3.5 Turbo) in generating relevant responses for Umrah-related queries. To achieve this, the study developed a fine-tuned version of the pre-trained language model by incorporating Umrah-specific data. Prompt engineering techniques were also implemented to guide the model’s responses. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism was integrated to enable the model to retrieve external data. Real-time web scraping capabilities were also developed to allow the model to provide up-to-date information. 
- **Methods**: The research methods involved fine-tuning the GPT-3.5 Turbo model with a specialized dataset, integrating RAG, and adding real-time web scraping functionalities. The collective impact of these techniques on the model’s performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, relevance, response time, and fallback mechanisms. The evaluation of the proposed method was conducted through a set of 150 Umrah-related questions, comparing the enhanced model's responses with those generated by the base GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The responses were analysed using established NLP evaluation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and Cosine Similarity. 
- **Results**: The findings reveal several key insights: 1) The combination of fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and RAG with real-time web scraping improves the model's accuracy and relevance. 2) The model's ability to access real-time information provides a distinct advantage in scenarios requiring current data, such as travel logistics. 3) The study identified challenges with RAG, particularly in retrieving relevant documents, which were addressed through corrective measures like document augmentation and web scraping. 4) The integration of these methods resulted in a noticeable trade-off in response time, with the enhanced model being slower than the base model. 5) Overall, the proposed model demonstrates significant improvements in generating relevant and accurate responses for Umrah-related queries, despite the identified limitations.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Notebooks/**
This folder contains detailed Jupyter Notebooks that walk through the different stages of the project implementation, including:
- **01_Convert_PDF_to_Vector_Database.ipynb**: Prepares the document dataset for use in the RAG system by converting PDF documents to vector embeddings using OpenAI embeddings.
- **02_Preparing_50_Conversation_with_500_QnA_Pairs.ipynb**: Details the process of preparing the 50 conversational samples based on 500 question-answer pairs specific to Umrah-related queries.
- **03_Fine_Tuning_Model_GPT_3.5Turbo.ipynb**: Demonstrates the fine-tuning process for the GPT-3.5 Turbo model using OpenAI's API with additional Umrah-specific context.
- **04_Regular_RAG_System.ipynb**: Implements the RAG system that retrieves documents from the vector database using OpenAI embeddings, then re-ranks them using BM25.
- **05_RealTime_WebScraping_SerpAPI_&_Evaluation.ipynb**: Performs real-time web scraping and integrates the scraped information into the RAG system for real-time responses, with evaluation metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE.

### 2. **pdf_docs_for_RAG/**
This folder contains 5 important PDF documents used as the source material for the RAG system:
- **01-Buku Tuntunan Manasik Haji dan Umrah 2024 Kemenag.pdf**
- **02-FIQH PRAKTIS HAJI DAN UMROH.pdf**
- **03-Manasik Haji-Indonesia.pdf**
